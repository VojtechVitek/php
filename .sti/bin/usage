This image is not intended to be invoked by \`docker run\` command.
Instead, it serves as a builder image that picks up a specified
PHP application's source code (from a GIT repository) and creates
a runnable RHEL-7 Docker image from it.

See https://github.com/VojtechVitek/php#usage for more details.
